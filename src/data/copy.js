  pressRelease: "Individuals are coming together to create tools to respond to COVID-19 as part of the Pandemic Response Hackathon. One such tool is the Co-Caring Dashboard, created for citizens of California to get a quick estimate of how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as #shelterinplace, are having an impact on reducing the spread of COVID-19.\nCalifornia currently has 3,829 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with a 27.71% change today (831 additional cases).  https://ncov2019.live/data\nIn order to slow down the spread of the COVID-19, the best course of action currently available is #shelterinplace, also known as practicing “social distancing” by avoiding public places. You can see the positive impacts of #shelterinplace on reducing the curve here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/.\nThe Co-Caring Dashboard displays the local impact of #shelterinplace in each county in LA, by identifying the death rate by date, as this is currently the most accurate data point for tracking COVID-19. The dashboard is created in alignment with Vytality’s #co-caring movement, which aims to bring together community members in times of crisis for greater impact.\nAnother initiative of the #co-caring movement is sharing tips on how to #shelterinplace. You can do so effectively through 3 steps: 1) exercise, 2) social connection, and 3) inspiration.\nVytality Health is a social support platform for co-caring where people can document their health & wellness journeys while sharing deep, authentic support. We help build people’s personalized circles of support so we can all have transformative health and wellness.\n[[Read about and download the Rapid Response Tool for Coronavirus.]]((http://bit.ly/coronavirustool))"
