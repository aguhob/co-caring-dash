        <p>We are all caregivers and care receivers. As private individuals and as organizations, our current situation calls us to both. And in a crisis, efforts -- like neighbors helping neighbors, to organizations working with citizens and other organizations -- are often not scalable. In response to the ongoing challenge to track the spread of COVID-19 and to connect individuals, organizations and communities who want to help, we have created the #Co-Caring Dashboard.</p>
        <p>To use the #Co-Caring Dashboard, please scroll down for information about COVID-19 in your state and county.</p>
