        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>We are all caregivers and care receivers. Our current situation calls us to both. AndÂ in a crisis, efforts like neighbors helping neighbors, to organizations working with citizens and each other -- are often not scalable and disjointed. In response to the ongoing challenge to track the spread of COVID-19, we have created the #Co-Caring Dashboard which projects future coronavirus growth in the local California community.</p>
